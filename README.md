# black-scholes-option

"Black-Scholes posits that instruments such as stock shares or futures contracts will have a lognormal distribution of prices following a random walk with constant drift and volatility.

The equation uses this assumption and factors in other important variables to derive the price of a European-style call option.

The Black-Scholes equation requires six variables:

Volatility
The price of the underlying asset
The strike price of the option
The time until the expiration of the option
The risk-free interest rate
The type of option (call or put)
It's theoretically possible for options sellers to set rational prices with these variables for the options that they're selling.

The model predicts that the price of heavily traded assets follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility.

It incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the time value of money, the option's strike price, and the time to the option's expiry when it's applied to a stock option."
